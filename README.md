About:

This is our CPSC 349 Final Project! We worked all semester long to complete this. Hope you like it!

WEATHERMANIA is a web page that allows you to learn about various city forecasts.  All you have to do is head over to the 'Search' page and type in as many cities as you'd like! Afterwards, you are able to remove whatever cities you'd like.
